# Spring Framework Java Backend Project

## Overview
The Spring Framework Java Backend Project is aimed at modernizing and enhancing the functionality of a legacy travel agency application. This project focuses on developing a robust backend system using the Spring Framework to ensure scalability, security, and improved performance. The backend system provides RESTful APIs to facilitate communication with the frontend application, enabling seamless interaction and data exchange.

## Features
- **Modernized Backend:** Development of a modernized backend system using the Spring Framework to replace the legacy backend architecture.
- **RESTful APIs:** Creation of RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend Angular application and the backend system.
- **Data Handling:** Utilization of Spring Data JPA and Rest Repositories for efficient data handling, including CRUD operations and database interactions.
- **Security:** Implementation of cross-origin support and input validation for enhanced security and data integrity.
- **Structured Architecture:** Organization of project components into packages for controllers, entities, DAO (Data Access Objects), and services to maintain a structured and scalable codebase.

## Technologies Used
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 
- **Spring Framework** 
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **MySQL Database** 
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development
- **GitLab:** Version Control System for managing source code
- **Angular:** Frontend framework for building web applications

## Installation
To set up and run the Spring Framework Java Backend Project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
3. Configure the application properties file with your database credentials and other configuration settings.
4. Build and run the application.

## Usage
1. Once the backend application is running, it will expose RESTful endpoints that can be accessed by the frontend Angular application.
2. Use these endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the data stored in the MySQL database.
3. Monitor application logs and debug any issues that arise during development and testing.
